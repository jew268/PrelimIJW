Problem 2)
Problem2a is the main code that generates the three requested graphs.

Broken memory and new memory are the supporting files.

P2Grah is the graph generated from problem 2a.

function get.jl changes the parameter values for the main in problem 2a.
Then, I would input into the main function each parameter value and then run the main function. Then the main function would give me values. I would use these values implementing central difference scheme for those new values that are output. Last, this should spit out the S matrix.


Problem 1)
Problem 1 P1 inlcudes problem 1 and supporting information for problem 2.

Problem 3)
Problem3order file gives the order of my metabolites in my S matrix.
Problem3main maximizes translation rate.
Prblem3 matrices gives my S matrix.
Problem3C shows the most sensitve to fluxes.
